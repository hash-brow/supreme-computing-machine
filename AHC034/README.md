# Atcoder Heuristic Contest 034

## Initial thoughts and approaches
1. Looking at the scoring, the solution is penalized for any square $\neq$ 0 but the solution remains valid
2. Visit each square once, trying a random order, e.g. spiral or snake
3. Can try something like Simulated Annealing to improve the state of the solution
